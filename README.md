# 👋 Hi, I'm Andreas Nore

I'm a systems programmer who enjoys working close to the metal — drawn to embedded development, C programming, and low-level architecture.

-  Finishing a Bachelor's in Informatics: Robotics and Intelligent Systems
-  Building tools in C: logging systems, graphics backends, minimal APIs
- I like building from scratch and I enjoy understanding every layer.
